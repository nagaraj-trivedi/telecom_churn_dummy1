# Telecom Churn Case Study
> This project is about EDA Analysis on customer churn data for past few years , covering data about their telecom packaage(data, std, fb etc), recharge and amount of usage patterns
Exploratory Analysis would ensure we get understanding the past behavior , the patterns , the financial evaluation score and ratios to take better decision on the churn probability

## Problem Statement and Analysis Approach
> To Analyze the telecom churn  data set with all the information on telecom customers churn of its historical data and understand how some variable impacts or not towards the telecom churn.

### Analysis approach
- Understand the features parameters and factors affecting the telecom churn.
- Use EDA principles to analyse the data set 
- Clean , remove, rename and derive parameters ( columns )
- Use Data visualization methods to understand the relationship between the variables 
- Build different models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Compare the KPI parameters and do the final selection
- Provide a list of important parameters and analysis on that to provide business recmondation
